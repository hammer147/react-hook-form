# React Hook Form

This is an example of how to use forms.

- We started with a simple form (simple-form.tsx).  
- Then we used react-hook-form (rhf.tsx).  
- Then we added zod (rhf-zod.tsx).
- And finally we added a server action (rhf-zod-server-action.tsx).

Note that we call the server action in the SubmitHandler (not via the action attribute of the form).
